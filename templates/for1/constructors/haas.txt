Haas Formula LLC,competing as Haas F1 Team, is an American Formula One racing team established by NASCAR Cup Series team co-owner Gene Haas in April 2014. The team originally intended to make its debut at the start of the 2015 season but later elected to postpone their entry until the 2016 season.The team principal for the Haas F1 team is Guenther Steiner.
The team is headquartered in Kannapolis, North Carolina, United States – 31 mi (50 km) from Charlotte – alongside sister team and NASCAR entrant Stewart-Haas Racing, though the two teams are separate entities. The team also established a forward base in Banbury, England, for the purpose of turning cars around between races during the European part of the calendar.
Haas was the first American constructor to submit an F1 entry after the failed US F1 project in 2010, and it is the first American constructor to compete since the unrelated Haas Lola outfit raced in the 1985 and 1986 seasons. The Haas Lola team was owned by former McLaren boss Teddy Mayer and Carl Haas, who was not related to Gene Haas.
Following the collapse of Marussia F1 during the 2014 season and the auctioning of their assets, Haas purchased the team's Banbury headquarters to serve as a forward base for their operations.
Unrestricted by testing regulations until the time the team actually entered Formula One, Haas shook its new car down in December 2015 ahead of official pre-season testing at Barcelona in early 2016.[14] Haas approached Italian manufacturer Dallara to build their chassis, with a power unit supplied by Ferrari.Former Jaguar and Red Bull Racing technical director Guenther Steiner is the team principal.Haas confirmed its new car had passed the mandatory FIA crash tests in January 2016.
