Scuderia AlphaTauri, or simply AlphaTauri, is an Italian Formula One racing team and constructor. It is one of two Formula One constructors owned by Austrian beverage company Red Bull, the other being Red Bull Racing. The constructor was rebranded for the 2020 Formula One World Championship from "Toro Rosso" to "AlphaTauri" in order to promote the AlphaTauri fashion brand.According to Franz Tost and Helmut Marko, Scuderia AlphaTauri is no longer the junior team but the sister team to Red Bull Racing.

In September 2019, Toro Rosso announced their intention to change their naming rights for the 2020 championship.It was announced on 1 December 2019 that the team had selected "AlphaTauri" as their new moniker to promote parent company Red Bull's fashion label of the same name by purchasing Toro Rosso's naming rights. Thus, they became Scuderia AlphaTauri and retired the Scuderia Toro Rosso moniker after fourteen years .The team's involvement in Formula One can be traced back to the 1985 season when they first competed as Minardi. The team has been owned by Red Bull GmbH since the 2006 season.

AlphaTauri had Daniil Kvyat and Pierre Gasly drive for them in their debut season.The team remained with the Honda engine, being the team's engine partner since the 2018 season.Sérgio Sette Câmara, Sébastien Buemi, and Jüri Vips were signed as the team's test drivers. The team achieved its first podium finish and race victory under the AlphaTauri name at the 2020 Italian Grand Prix, which also marked Pierre Gasly's first race victory and the first win for a French Formula One driver since Olivier Panis won the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix 24 years prior. AlphaTauri ended the year in 7th place on 107 points, 75 for Gasly and 32 for Kvyat.
